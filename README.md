# Sport_Manager

It's a simple project using Java Spring and Hibernate to generate results of football matches in league. Each team is playing with others and the results are saved and displayed in actual league table. League table is displaying positions of teams order by number of scored points in simulated matches. For now results between of all teams are generated randomly. In future I'd like to generate results based on skills of each players of teams. Team with better players will have more chance to win.

Each team consists of players and workers.

TODO list:
- generated results based on players skills.
- add more leagues and teams.
- add sports facilities like: stadium, sports academy etc.
